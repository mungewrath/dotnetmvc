This was a quick POC to get myself familiar with ASP.NET Core and VS Code.

Some useful things to check out here...
- Configuring dependency injection: Startup.ConfigureServices()
- Customizing config:
  * Per environment: appssettings.<Production/Development>.json
  * Mapping config from json: TestConfig.cs, and Startup.ConfigureServices()
- Using dependency injection: HomeController and BusinessMan constructors
- Dockerizing the app: exportToDocker.sh and runDocker.sh scripts [requires Linux environment]
